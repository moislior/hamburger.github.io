    <p>Fast food meals have come a long way from hamburgers. The new "wrap" concept is also considered fast food and is the newest concept in the fast food business. The chicken nugget changed the way Americans ate chicken. The overwhelming majority of chicken sold is as chunks and processed meat as opposed to whole birds. In the fast food, chicken has twice as much fat as hamburgers because they are fried. But continue to gain popularity with the public.Most fast food is fried. Fried food tastes great, and people don't seem to care about the fat aspect. Only a few fast food companies such as Kentucky Fried Chicken has changed its name (to KFC,) in order to be more responsible in the way the company is presented to the public. I don't think people's eating habits have become healthier. Right now, in the fast food industry the trend is to add bacon to their meals. Only "Subway" is working to promote a more healthy way of eating.

    <p>Fast food chains spend a large amount of marketing to get
      the attention of children. People form their eating habits
      as children so they try to nurture clients as youngsters.
      It's very important that the fast food companies make sure
      that their fast food meals for children are healthier. 
      Parents think that chicken meals are healthier than burgers,
      but they are not since they are fried.</p>

    <p>Hamburgers are now made in gigantic factories. There was a time
      when hamburgers were made from beef from one cow. Fast food chains
      use to buy their meat from local suppliers in a local region. So 
      fewer cattle were used to get the meat. The fast food chain had such
      a demand for hamburger meat that tasted the same they helped create
      factories to make ground beef. It's all very scientific. Today a typical
      fast food hamburger has dozens or hundreds of strips of beef from different
      cattle, in different regions blended together. So, if you have one sick cow in
      the batch, then the risk of getting sick is greater.</p>
      <h5>The real cost of eating the food isn't reflected in the price on the menu. This food tastes good is the salt, fat and sugars added to it. So when you look at the rise in the obesity rate of people and the rise in the success of the fast food chains they parallel each other. About 300,000 people die each year from being obese or overweight, this is second only to smoking. Fast food isn't the only reason people are gaining weight, but it contributes to it.Fast food is heavy on fat, salt and sugar, and reduced nutrient. Fifteen percent of American children are overweight and the number is growing. Fast food is quick and easy and working parents resort to it and it's no fuss and you get a toy.</h5>

        <li>This year Americans will spend over $110 billion on fast food, more than they'll spend on movies, books, magazines, newspapers, videos, and recorded music combined.</li>
        <li>Every day about one quarter of the U.S. population eats fast food.</li>
        <li>Roughly 12% of all American workers have worked at McDonald's.</li>
        <li>The golden arches are now more widely recognized than the Christian cross.</li>
        <li>Children often recognize the McDonald's logo before they recognize their own name.</li>
        <li>American children now get about one quarter of their total vegetable servings in the form of potato chips and French fries.</li>
        <li>The typical teenage boy in the United States now gets about 10% of his daily calories from soda.</li>
        <li>The rate of obesity among American children has doubled since the late 1970s.</li>
        <li>A fast food soda that sells for $1.29 costs the restaurant about ten cents, a markup of more than 1200 percent.</li>
        <li>McDonald's is now the nation's largest purchaser of beef, pork, and potatoes. It is the second-largest purchaser of chicken in the U.S.</li>
        <li>Hundreds of local slaughterhouses used to supply the United States with beef; today thirteen large slaughterhouses supply most of the nation's beef.</li>
        <li>A typical fast food hamburger contains meat from dozens or even hundreds of cattle.</li>
        <li>Because fast food is so highly processed, much of its flavor is destroyed, so the tastes of most fast food are manufactured at a series of special chemical plants in New Jersey.</li>

    <p>he FDATrusted Source suggests that a diet high in salt often increases a person’s blood pressure, making a person more prone to heart attacks, stroke, kidney disease, or heart disease.
    The FDA also notes that a diet high in trans fats raises the amountTrusted Source of low-density lipoprotein or “bad” cholesterol and lowers the amount of high-density lipoprotein or “good” cholesterol. This means that a person is more likely to develop heart disease.</p>

    <p>Fast food tends to be high in salt, sugar, saturated fats, trans fats, calories, and processed preservatives and ingredients. A wealth of well-conducted research has proven the negative health effects of consuming too much of these food components. In the short term, fast food impacts blood sugar and blood pressure, increases inflammation, and may mean an individual does not eat enough necessary nutrients. In the long term, a diet rich in fast food could lead to issues with digestion, immunity, inflammation, heart health, obesity, and more. Not all fast food is bad, however. Certain menu items might be lower in these substances than others, while some fast food outlets might focus on providing more healthy options. To preserve health, a person should try to identify fast food items that contain less salt, fat, sugar, and total carbohydrates and generally try to limit the amount of fast food they consume.</p>
